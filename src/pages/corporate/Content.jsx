        A few points to keep in mind when exploring The Dandelion® as your
        destination:
        <br />
        1. Check-in time is 14:00 hrs & Check-out time is 11:00 hrs, although if
        your guests wish to arrive a little early we could start their
        conference/event in the morning and even complete Lunch prior to
        check-in. <br />
        2. Due to our remote location, network connectivity is only available at
        two designated areas on the property. At The Dandelion® we do not have
        any broadband connectivity and the only internet access we have is via
        satellite. Satellite connections tend to be rather slow and are good
        only for basic internet connectivity. Wi-Fi services, if absolutely
        necessary, can be availed at the property at a nominal charge. <br />
        3. Kindly note that outside food & beverages (soft or hard) are not
        permitted on our property. <br />

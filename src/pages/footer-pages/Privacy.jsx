          The Dandelion, henceforth referred to as “The Resort” collects
          information about our guests and visitors to our web sites so that we
          can provide an experience that is responsive to our guests needs. We
          endeavour to collect information only with your knowledge and with
          your permission if necessary. The types of personally identifiable
          information that we collect may include your name, home, work and
          email addresses, telephone and fax numbers, credit card information,
          date of birth, gender, and lifestyle information such as room
          preferences, leisure activities, names and ages of children, and other
          information necessary to fulfill special requests (e.g., health
          conditions that require special room accommodations). The Resort is
          fully committed to providing you with information about the collection
          and use of personally identifiable information furnished by, or
          collected from, visitors while using our web sites, products and
          services. It is our practice not to ask you for information unless we
          need it or intend to use it. <br />
          <br />
          To ensure that your personally identifiable information is accurate
          and up to date, we encourage you to regularly review and update your
          information as appropriate (e.g., in the event your home or email
          address changes, or you wish to add an additional method for us to
          communicate with you). <br />
          <br />
          The Resort recognizes the importance of information security, and is
          constantly reviewing and enhancing our technical, physical, and
          logical security rules and procedures to help protect your personally
          identifiable information against loss, misuse, and alteration while
          under our control. Although 'guaranteed security' does not exist
          either on or off the Internet, we safeguard your information using
          both procedural and technical safeguards, including password controls,
          "firewalls", etc.
